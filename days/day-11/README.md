Day 11
======

Let's detect some lies on day 11. Bad children will get no presents.

One wire to ground for one hand, the other wire on an analog pin pulled up by 470 kOhm for the other hand.
The Rings are already pulled up with 10 MOhm but this should not be a problem (result ~450 kOhm).

What I have learned
-------------------

v0.1.0
- How to read ADC values
- the play_tone function does not work properly

v0.2.0
- Using another microbit BSP to be able to use PWM for sound
- Setting up the project for embassy (the new BSP is based on embassy)
- There is another [good resource for embedded Rust](https://mb2.implrust.com/index.html)
- There is so much more to learn....
