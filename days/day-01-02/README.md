Day 1 and 2
===========

Basic setup of microbit and development environment.

Day 1 is just a LED in the original.

Day 2 has the MCU and a blinking LED. So lets blink one of the matrix LEDs of the microbit.

I have chosen to do it on bare metal (see video). 
For the later games I will step upwards in the abstraction layers.
