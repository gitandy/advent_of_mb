Day 6/7
=======

The 6th and 7th days features a Hot Wire game.

A buckled wire is connected to Ring 0. Another wire with a loop is connected to ground.
Follow the buckeled wire to the end with the inside of the loop. 
If both wire touches, a sound is played and the game is lost.

Therefore, some sound is added.
