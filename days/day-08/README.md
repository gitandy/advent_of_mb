Day 8
=====

Day 8 brings us a Quiz-Buzzer to play noises for Right and Wrong.

Button A plays a positive sound (da-diiii). Button B plays a failing sound (di-daaaa).


What I have learned or unanswered questions
-------------------------------------------

- I can't hand the `peripherals` or `p0` to a function (even not as reference). The borrow checker yells at me 😉. Is there any way?
