Day 9
=====

Train your reaction on day 9.

The LEDs show random binary numbers. Button A must be pressed only if the number is 12 (bit 2 and 3).
If it matches, a positive sound (da-diiii) is played. Otherwise, a fail sound (di-daaaa).

Let's have LEDs and sound all together.

What I have learned
-------------------

v0.1.0
- PAC layer is way easier than bare metal

v0.2.0
- BSP layer is cool and reduces more code
